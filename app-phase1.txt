1) App Summary
App Type & Purpose

ZemNet is a community Wi-Fi access marketplace for Burkina Faso. It enables Hosts (Wi-Fi owners) to sell short internet access passes and Users to discover nearby hotspots, pay via mobile money or platform wallet credit, receive a voucher, and connect through a captive portal. Access control is enforced locally on the router (OpenWrt + openNDS) using offline-verifiable vouchers, so connections remain reliable even when mobile data is weak.

Non-goals (out of scope for v1)

A full Admin mobile application (Ops is web-first; minimal internal tools only).

Full offline payment processing (payments require provider confirmation; only voucher validation is offline).

Advanced fraud/ML, automated chargebacks, complex dispute workflows (basic manual tools only).

Multi-currency and tax-grade accounting.

Roaming federation (Passpoint/Hotspot 2.0) and RADIUS-based enterprise authentication.

Ed25519/COSE voucher signing (v1 uses HS256; upgrade later).

2) Users & Roles
Guest (not logged in)

Can discover hotspots (map/list) without login.

Cannot purchase until logged in (recommended), or can purchase with minimal OTP step at checkout.

User (Buyer)

OTP login, profile basics.

View hotspot details (GPS pin + landmark text) and host-defined plans.

Purchase via Wave/Orange/Moov or pay with Wallet Credit.

Store vouchers offline; open connect help; copy code / view QR.

View purchase history and wallet ledger.

Receive and confirm cash-in requests initiated by hosts.

Host (Seller)

Complete KYC + payout method.

Claim router via QR and configure hotspot metadata.

Create/update host-defined plans; pause sales.

Accept cash and initiate cash-in to credit a user’s wallet (expires in 10 minutes).

View cash-in history, sessions (approx), earnings, payouts.

Admin/Ops (optional, web-first)

Approve/reject KYC; freeze/unfreeze hosts.

Configure platform fee rates, cash-in commission rates, limits.

Review suspicious cash-ins; manual reversals/refunds.

Run payout batches and troubleshoot failures.

3) Core Features (5–7)

Hotspot Discovery (No Login Required)

Map and low-data list of nearby online hotspots using GPS pins + landmark-only descriptions.

Host-Defined Plans & Sales Controls

Hosts create and manage pricing plans (time/data/price), and can pause/resume sales.

Pass Purchase (Mobile Money + Wallet Credit)

Users pay via Wave/Orange/Moov or spend wallet credit; voucher is delivered instantly after confirmation.

Platform Wallet Credit (Cash-In + Spend Anywhere)

Any KYC-approved host can accept cash and initiate a wallet credit for a user; the user confirms; credit is usable at any host.

Policy: Wallet credit is not refundable to cash.

Offline Voucher Wallet + Captive Portal Connect

Vouchers stored securely on-device; users can connect even when the app has no internet (router validates offline).

One-Device-Per-Voucher Enforcement

Each voucher can be used by exactly one device (MAC binding on first use, enforced by the router).

Earnings & Payouts

Hosts see sales/fees/commission summaries and receive scheduled payouts; payout states are transparent.

4) Primary User Journeys (at least 2)
Journey A — Discover → Buy pass → Connect (Happy Path)

Guest opens app → sees hotspots on Map/List (no login).

Select hotspot → view host-defined plans → choose plan.

App prompts OTP login to purchase (if not logged in).

Choose payment method (Wave/Orange/Moov or Wallet).

On success → voucher shown (QR + code) and saved to wallet.

User joins SSID → captive portal opens → enters voucher.

Router validates voucher offline; binds voucher to device (first MAC); grants access.

Edge case: Payment is completed but webhook confirmation is delayed → Payment Status shows “En attente” with refresh, “J’ai payé”, and Support link; voucher appears once confirmed.

Journey B — Cash top-up at Host A → Spend at Host B (Happy Path)

User opens Wallet → shows Top-up QR (user identifier).

Host A selects “Recharger un client” → scans QR or enters phone → enters amount → collects cash.

Cash-in request created (expires in 10 minutes).

User receives notification/request → confirms.

Wallet balance increases by the full cash amount.

User buys a pass at Host B using Wallet → voucher issued → connect through portal.

Edge case: User does not confirm within 10 minutes → request expires; host sees “Expiré” and can re-initiate.

“Rechargement expiré. Demandez à l’hôte de recommencer.”

10) Acceptance Criteria

 All IA screens implemented and reachable.

 Guests can discover hotspots (map/list) without login.

 Host-defined plans can be created/edited and displayed on Hotspot Details.

 Purchase journey works end-to-end (provider payment and wallet payment).

 Cash-in journey works end-to-end:

 Host initiates cash-in

 User confirms within 10 minutes

 Wallet balance updates

 One-device-per-voucher enforced (voucher cannot be reused by another device).

 Every data surface has loading/empty/error states.

 All interactive components have pressed/disabled/loading states.

 Accessibility:

 Inputs have labels and accessible error text

 Tap targets ≥ 44px

 QR screens provide text fallback

 Offline-first:

 Vouchers available offline in Wallet

 Connect Help works offline

11) Open Questions / Assumptions
Open Questions (remaining)

Rates: What are the exact percentages for platform fee (on voucher sales) and cash-in commission (paid to cash-in host)?

Limits: Daily cash-in limits per host and per user (to reduce fraud) — confirm numbers.

Host hardware: Can we assume hosts have smartphones with camera for QR scan (or do we need USSD/SMS host flow)?

Pilot: Confirm pilot cities, target hotspot count, and default discovery radius by city density.

Assumptions (until confirmed)

Platform fee applies to voucher sales (wallet + mobile money).

Cash-in commission is paid to the cash-in host (funded from platform fee pool or a configurable budget), while the user wallet is credited with the full cash amount.

Initial limits (adjustable): per-host cash-in 50,000 XOF/day; per-user wallet top-up 20,000 XOF/day.

Hosts use smartphones in MVP; manual phone entry remains as fallback.

GPS pins are stored, and landmark-only text is required for usability; privacy jitter is not applied unless later requested.
